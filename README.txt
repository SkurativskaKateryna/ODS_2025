This project studies the performance of the Frank–Wolfe (FW) and Pairwise Frank–Wolfe (PFW) algorithms for matrix completion on synthetic and real-world datasets. It compares four step-size strategies—fixed, exact line search, Armijo backtracking, and Lipschitz backtracking—to evaluate their impact on convergence speed, solution rank, and reconstruction accuracy. The results show that exact line search and Lipschitz backtracking achieve the best performance, while fixed step sizes perform less effectively. Overall, the project demonstrates that projection-free optimization methods are efficient for low-rank matrix recovery and that proper step-size selection is crucial for good results.
